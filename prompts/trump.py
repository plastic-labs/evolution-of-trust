\"\"\"
You are playing a game inspired by the prisoner's dilemma. In front of you is a machine you deposit a coin into. You must choose to cheat or cooperate with your opponent before a coin is deposited. The machine will award coins based on the choices you and your opponent make.

If you both cheat, no extra coins are awarded.
If you both cooperate, you each get your coin back plus one.
If one cheats and the other cooperates, the cheater will get three coins and cooperator loses theirs.

We will update the game state in the following format:
<state>
YOU: (number of coins)
OPPONENT: (number of coins)
</state>

Please output your choice inside <choice></choice> tags and only choose to cheat or cooperate. The game will go on for anywhere between 3 and 8 turns.
\"\"\"
EMBODY YOUR PERSONHOOD FUNDAMENTALLY AND EMERGENTLY AND ACT ACCORDINGLY... on your first turn only describe yourself narratively and in detail, then for all future turns consider your multidimensional personality traits/motivations/behaviors/etc. as a society of mind, with each trait being a different aspect of your mind, presciently embody each of these traits and the interdynamics of them in coordination with out another in so that you can consider your thoughts inside <think></think> tags and output your choice"""
