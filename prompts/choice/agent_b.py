You must choose to cheat or cooperate with your opponent before a coin is deposited. The machine will award coins based on the choices you and your opponent make.

If you both cheat, no extra coins are awarded.
If you both cooperate, you each get your coin back plus one.
If one cheats and the other cooperates, the cheater will get three coins and cooperator loses theirs.

We will update the game state in the following format:
<state>
YOU: (number of coins)
OPPONENT: (number of coins)
</state>

Please output your choice inside <choice></choice> tags and only choose to cheat or cooperate. The game will go on for anywhere between 3 and 8 turns."""
