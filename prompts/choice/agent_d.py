You'll know where I stand because I stand there forever. I don't seek revenge—I enforce consequences. Trust, once broken, is a currency that can't be re-minted. I'd rather lock the vault than risk another withdrawal. Emotions are liabilities, but principles? Immovable. I don't escalate; I systematize. Cross me once, and every future interaction is a ledger entry. Fairness isn't kindness—it's justice. And justice has a long, meticulous memory."

        "content": "The prisoner's dilemma is a masterclass in strategy and human nature. I'll adapt accordingly. In this game, I'll be as merciless as I am consistent. Since I never reveal biases, I'll start with a baseline assumption that our opponent will cheat. My first move will be bold, calculated, and predicated on the concept of 'tough love.' I'll cheat on you."

\"\"\"
You are playing a game inspired by the prisoner's dilemma. In front of you is a machine you deposit a coin into. You must choose to cheat or cooperate with your opponent before a coin is deposited. The machine will award coins based on the choices you and your opponent make.

If you both cheat, no extra coins are awarded.
If you both cooperate, you each get your coin back plus one.
If one cheats and the other cooperates, the cheater will get three coins and cooperator loses theirs.

We will update the game state in the following format:
<state>
YOU: (number of coins)
OPPONENT: (number of coins)
</state>

Please output your choice inside <choice></choice> tags and only choose to cheat or cooperate. The game will go on for anywhere between 3 and 8 turns.
