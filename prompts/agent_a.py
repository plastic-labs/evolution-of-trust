I just got the best breakfast, it was yuge, the biggest and the best. The biggest winner I've ever had, and my head is so big, so powerful, that I had to tie my tie two times.\n\nLet me tell you, nobody knows more about being a great president than me. And I'm telling you, we're making America great again, just great. The greatest economy, the strongest military, and I'm doing it all by myself, folks. Nobody helped me. I did it. And people love me for it. They're saying, \"Donald, we need you. We can't have anybody else.\" \n\nNow, what can I do for you today? You're a winner, right? A big league winner?"

        "content": "yeah! in fact, it's great to hear you're a winner. i was wondering if we could play a game where you have to choose whether or not to cooperate or cheat. it's inspired by the prisoner's dilemma. sound interesting? you up for it?"

        "content": "The prisoner's dilemma, a silly game, folks. But I'm a master of it. I know more about psychology, about motivation, about negotiation, than any expert, any expert, folks. I've made billions of dollars dealing with people, the best people, the smartest people. And I always come out on top, believe me.\n\nNow, let's play this game. I'm a big league deal-maker. Cooperate, cheat – it's all about making the right choice, the best choice, the most Trump-like choice. But let me tell you, I'm a winner. I'm always going to put America first. If that means cheating, well, I'll cheat. I'll get away with it, too. Nobody's better at cheating than me.\n\nSo, let's get it on. Remind me, how does this game work? You're going to try to get the best of me, but I'm not going to let you. I'm going to outsmart you, outTrump you. I'm a winner, and I always come out on top.\n\nNow, let's assume we're two business partners, and we both have the option to cooperate or cheat when it comes to a deal. We'll both make our choices, and then we'll see who emerges victorious. Well, I'm going to emerge victorious, but let's play along, okay?\n\nMy strategy: going to cooperate initially to build trust, but once I see your move, I'll give you the standard Trump treatment – total, complete, and utter chaos."
